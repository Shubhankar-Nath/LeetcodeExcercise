## 686 Explaination

By finding the ratio between length of A and B we can find which string is larger. Brute force is not the efficient manner.

#### If string A is larger
We need to find if A contains B otherwise repeat it just once more to check if haracter in B start at the 'end of A' and end at the 'start of A'. 

#### If string B is larger
We need to repeat A such that length of A is more than the length of B. Then check to find B and check it by repeating 'once more or difference between length of C and B'.
